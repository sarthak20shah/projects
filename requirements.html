Create a app with multiple routes with below details:
1. A page with signup and login tab with all the necessary validations (Use localstorage to store
the data and verify on login tab)
2. Once login is successful, get any dummy API available on the internet to fetch some list of
information for e.g users or it can be anything of your preference and show it in a tabular format.
3. Add a column at last to view, edit and delete the records from the list
4. On clicking the View button, a pop-up should be opened with respective row details.
5. On clicking on the Edit button, a new route should be opened with preloaded populated data
in the fields and I should be able to edit them. On save, I should be back to the listing page with
updated data without refreshing the page.
6. On clicking the Delete button, a confirmation should be asked, and action based on selection.
7. On the header, place a button to Add a new record and to add the item, use a different route.
Once added, back to the listing page with the newly added record too.
<!-- 8. Create a not found page too if I type or change anything in URL --done -->



Would be great, if covered:
9. Every user will be having a birthday, if the Birthdate matches the current date, a notification
should be shown to the user wishing him and should stay there until the user has manually
closed it. Once manually closed, it should be only shown next year
10. I want to deploy this project under sub-directory. Do the necessary steps for the same
Expected libraries to be used:
Front-end: ReactJs
Standards: Use ES6 minimum or above
UI design: ANTD and Styled components
State management: Redux saga/thunk
Storing the data:
- states
- props
- localstorage or use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ dummy APIs to fetch the list, post
data, update data and delete
Submitting the practical
- Upload your practical to a github repo
- Prepare a nice ReadMe file with all necessary steps and dependencies used on your system
and how to make the program run.
